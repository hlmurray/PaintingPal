<p>Painting Pal is a mobile application built and designed by Hannah Murray. Hannah is a Senior at the College of Charleston double majoring in Computer Science and Computing in the Arts. Painting Pal serves as her final Capstone project as a Senior graduating with a Computing in the Arts degree. Her envision for Painting Pal is to be a handheld helper for students enrolled in beginner painting course. </p>

<p>Her idea for Painting Pal was inspired by her experience in a Painting 1 course at the College of Charleston, and both features within the application were actual tips given to her class by her instructor at the time, Jonathan Yoerger. The ultimate goal of Painting Pal is to give these painting students inspiration and painting technique tips by analyzing and annotating color relationships and then connecting the painter with similar famous artists based on style and technique and also recommends famous works of art. </p>
